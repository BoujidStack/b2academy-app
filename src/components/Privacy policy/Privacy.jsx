        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Last revision: 1st of November, 2022</h2>
          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>This document includes the terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") of the platform ("Platform") hosted on the web site https://founderz.com/ ("Website") owned by Founderz Emprendimiento, S.L. ("Founderz" or "We") with registered office at Pineda de Mar, 08397, Barcelona, CIF number B06944375, registered in the Commercial Register of Barcelona, volume 47908, folio 19, sheet B 566041 and contact at hola@founderz.com.

The purpose of these Terms of Use is to regulate the access, navigation and contracting of the various Online Programs offered by Founderz ("Program/s") by those users who have registered on the Platform ("Users") and those who visit the Platform ("Visitors").

By browsing the Platform and/or registering for the Program(s), the User or Visitor accepts these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Otherwise, the User or Visitor must cease using the Platform immediately.

Founderz, through the registration to the Program(s), makes available to the Users a training Platform that offers the User access to the selected Program, in microlearning format in online mode from pre-recorded lectures ("Lectures") on the specific subject matter of the respective Program , as well as access to a virtual campus with a variety of additional content of the selected Program including the interactions of the online community (all together the “Services”).</p>
          <h2>2. How to register?</h2>
          <h3>a) User Registration</h3>
          <p>In order to enroll in the Program, the User must register on the Platform, after which he/she will have access to all the content of Conferences and the online community for a period of time in principle unlimited ("Lifetime").

The term defined as Lifetime may be reduced in the event of (i) dissolution or (ii) entry into a liquidation process or (iii) sale (partial or total) of Founderz Emprendimiento, S.L., or (iv) when Founderz considers it in its sole discretion. The aforementioned reduction of the term will in no case generate an economic compensation in favor of the User. In any case Founderz will provide the User access to the content of the respective Program for a minimum period of 1 year from registration.

Once the User registers for the Program, he/she must complete the bank details required to proceed with the payment of the Services, as set forth in the "Payment Method" section, and must register his/her User by providing his/her name and surname, e-mail address and password.

Founderz reserves the right to modify the contents accessible on the Website and the Platform (remove or add Conferences), without, however, generally reducing the service. In the event of a substantial reduction in the content of the training, Founderz will refund a proportional part of the Price (see below).</p>
          <h3>b) Price</h3>
          <p>The price of each Program will be as defined in the "Our Programs" section of the Website and will always be expressed in Euro currency and including applicable VAT, which will allow the User to access all the training content, as well as the online community. In addition, the amount may be subject to discounts offered by Founderz, for which Founderz will provide the applicable discount code for each promotion.</p>
          <h3>c) Payment method</h3>
          <p>The transmission of personal or banking data is conducted using a secure environment, a server based on the standard security technology SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). All information transmitted by the User travels encrypted through the network.

Likewise, the data entered by the User about his/her credit or debit card are entered directly to Stripe Inc. (payment gateway) and, therefore, are not entered or registered in any Founderz server, and will be treated according to Stripe's legal conditions.

When paying by credit or with debit card, you will always be asked for the following information: the card number, the expiration date, and a Validation Code that matches the last three digits of the number printed in italics on the back of your card, thus offering more guarantees about the security of the transaction. This form of payment is valid only on the website.

Once the requested bank details have been entered in the Stripe platform, payment for the contracted services will be made in a single payment.

When the amount of a purchase has been fraudulently or improperly charged using the number of a payment card, the cardholder may demand the immediate cancellation of the charge. In this case, the corresponding debit entries and re-credit the accounts of the supplier and the cardholder will be made as soon as possible.</p>
          <h2>3. User Obligations</h2>
          <p>The User agrees to make proper and lawful use of the contents and Platform and by way of example, but not limited to, not to use them to (i) engage in illegal activities or contrary to good faith and public order; (ii) cause damage to physical and logical systems Founderz or other users; (iii) attempt to access and, where appropriate, use the email accounts of other users and modify or record data.

You agree that Founderz grants you a non-exclusive right to access the Services and therefore your account is personal and non-transferable.

Specifically, the User assumes the following obligations:
